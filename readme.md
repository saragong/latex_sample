# Code Sample: LaTeX

In this LaTeX code sample, I have included (1) an excerpt of a data description appendix I wrote as a research assistant at USC, and (2) a homework problem from a machine learning class. Note that the table in (1) is highly condensed: because the survey is still unpublished, I've only included the metadata.
